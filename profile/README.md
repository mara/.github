The **Mara ELT Framework** is a Python framework to build data pipelines.


It has been designed and build by [Dr. Martin Loetzsch](https://github.com/martin-loetzsch) at [Project A](https://github.com/project-a) as a lightweight data transformation framework for their ventures. Today the Mara Packages are maintained and developed further by the Mara Open Source community.

Example projects
----------------

Runnable apps that demonstrates how to build a data warehouse app with mara:

* [Mara Example Project 1](https://github.com/mara/mara-example-project-1) - example ELT integrates publicly available e-commerce and marketing data into a more general modeling and structure for highlighting the capabilities of the Mara framework
* [Mara Example Project 2](https://github.com/mara/mara-example-project-2) - example ELT integrates PyPi download stats and GitHub repo activitiy metrics into more general Python project activity stats
